        computer. You can also upload any png image to canvas and start making 
        any digital improvisation from this image. Just use save and load buttons located
        at toolbar header. Something did not go as planned? If you want to undo last step, use the undo

        This tool lets you generate two main elements – curves and dots. These can be
        generated simply by pressing "draw curves" or "draw dots" buttons. You can easily set
        curves width, or dots size, by changing the values of minimum and maximum width. 
        This can be done using the "minimum width/size" and "maximum width/size" sliders.
        Minimum width (or size) is 1 pixel, maximum is 25. You can also select how
        many elements should be generated per one click using the "number of elements" slider.
        You can create up to 50 elements per one click. If you do not want to generate only 
        black-and-white canvas, then you can change colors of elements and background. Note that
        if you change the color of the background, you will get the whole new and empty canvas.
